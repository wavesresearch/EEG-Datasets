  1. `Left/Right Hand MI [http://gigadb.org/dataset/100295]: ` Includes 52 subjects (38 validated subjects with discriminative features), results of physiological and psychological questionnares, EMG Datasets, location of 3D EEG electrodes, and EEGs for non-task related states
  2. `Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset [https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/eegmmidb/]:` Includes 109 volunteers, 64 electrodes, 2 baseline tasks (eye-open and eye-closed), motor movement, and motor imagery (both fists or both feet)
  
  
* **Emotion-Recognition**
  1. `DEAP [http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/] : ` Includes 32 subjects, each watchine 1-min long excerpts of music-videos, rated by users in terms of arousal/valence/like-dislike/dominanace/famaliarity, and frontal face recording of 22/32 subejcts.
  2. `Enterface'06 [http://www.enterface.net/results/] : ` Enterface'06 Project 07: EEG(64 Channels) + fNIRS + face video, Includes 16 subjects, where emotions were elicited through selected subset of IAPS dataset.
  3. `Imagined Emotion [http://headit.ucsd.edu/studies/3316f70e-35ff-11e3-a2a9-0050563f2612] : ` 31 subjects, subjects listen to voice recordings that suggest an emotional feeling and ask subjects to imagine an emotional scenario or to recall an experience in which they have felt that emotion before.

* **Error-Related Potentials (ErrP)**
  1. `BCI-NER Challenge [https://www.kaggle.com/c/inria-bci-challenge] : ` 26 subjects, 56 EEG Channels for a P300 Speller task, and labeled dataset for the response elicited when P300 decodes a correct or incorrect letter.
  
  2. `Monitoring ErrP in a target selection task [http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets]: ` 6 subjects with 64 EEG electrodes, watching a cursor move towards a target square, and elicited responses are labeled based on whether the cursor moves in right or wrong direction
